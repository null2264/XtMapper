### Null fork
This is my personal fork, made specifically for my keymappings for Genshin Impact so that I don't have to use uinput method anymore

#### Changes
- (Some) mouse buttons can be mapped for touch
- Middle Mouse Button support for Waydroid (requires my fork of [wayland-getevent](https://github.com/null2264/wayland-getevent))
  - MMB can be used to toggle aim mode
- AppID `xtr.keymapper` -> `xtr.keymapper.null`, allowing null fork app to co-exists with original app

## Development

### Build
- Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` or `./gradlew.bat assembleDebug` at the base directory of the project 

## Help and support

## Waydroid support
Due to how XtMapper works by reading input events directly from the kernel, there are certain limitations in implementing support for Android containers. 
An experimental solution was developed: https://github.com/Xtr126/wayland-getevent 
It is mostly a "hack" that we have to rely on due to how wayland/waydroid works.
