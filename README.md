### Null fork
> [!WARNING]
> Made for Waydroid, may not work on OEM Android devices

This is my personal fork, made specifically for my keymappings for Genshin Impact so that I don't have to use uinput method anymore

#### Changes
- (Some) mouse buttons can be mapped for touch
- Middle Mouse Button support for Waydroid (requires my fork of [wayland-getevent](https://github.com/null2264/wayland-getevent))
  - MMB can be used to toggle aim mode
- AppID `xtr.keymapper` -> `xtr.keymapper.null`, allowing null fork app to co-exists with original app
